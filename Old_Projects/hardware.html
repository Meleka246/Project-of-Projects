<p style="background-color:#000000;color:white">Here, I will be explaining whats really inside a 2010 or so laptop (a Dell Vostro 1015).</p>
<h2 style="font-align:center;">What's to begin with?</h2>
<p>First of all, there is the motherboard, the most vital part, and is the base of all computing. Without the motherboard, what could you put all the componets on? A picture of a motherboard is below.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img style="height:250px;align:middle" src="dellPictures/IMG_1408.JPG" /></div>
<h2>Where the 'brain' of the computer then?</h2>
<p>The 'brain' of the computer, is actually called a central processing unit, or CPU. The CPU is vital so that the computer can do millions of calculations a muinute, or as most people would call it, turning on your computer, logging in, making sure verythings booted up, and opening up an application (it's a longer procedure for the computer). Bellow is a picture of the CPU.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img style="height:250px" src="Photos/core_2_duo.jpg"></div>
<h2>How do you run programs then?</h2>
<p>When computers were first made public/personal, people would run there programs on their hard drives (this will be discussed later). This turned out to be a faliure, because hard drives at that time were just too slow. Then came the random acess memory stage of technology, or RAM. RAM is used to place applications, or files that are 'live' on the system, aka, running programs, opening and editing files, anything with files that are in constant use. Below is a picture of RAM.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img style="height:250px" src="Photos/ram.jpg"></div>
<h2>How would you store your files from RAM?</h2>
<p>Like I said before, before there was RAM, there was the hard drive. The hay a hard drive work, is not that hard to describe. First of all, there is a special metal disk that rotates usually around 5400 rotations per muinute, or RPM. When the disk moves, a needle moves back and forth on the disk. This needle has a special magnetic force, that 'writes' and 'reads' data, similar to reading and writing a paper. Below is an example, of what a hard drive looks like.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img style="height:250px" src="Photos/hdd_3tb.jpg"></div>
<h2>Ok then, how does the computer get its energy?</h2>
<p>The computer gets its energy from an electromagnetic generator, or power transformer. This special device, necessary if you want the computer to turn on, is used to regulate the power. Below is a picture of a power supply (usually they look diffrent, but this is a diffrent, newer, version).</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img style="height:250px" src="Photos/power_supply.jpg"></div>
<h2>How do the componets connect to each other then?</h2>
<p>The components connect through each other, through special electric wires that carry electricity. The computer shows the electricity as: 1=electricity 0=no electricity. 8 of these, is equal to one character on a computer, such as the following characters: !@a#c$c%)sda^vds(sd&*. those all take eight 0 and 1's. Bellow is some wires that the computer uses. </p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img style="height:250px" src="http://www.build-your-own-computer.net/image-files/computer-wiring-01.jpg"></div>
<h2>What are the keyboard, mouse, and monitor and what do they do?</h2>
<p>The keyboard, mouse, and monitor, are all just inputs and outputs for the computer. It is the only way to 'communicate' with the computer. Without those parts, the computer is inacessable to us. Bellow is a picture of one of the items, a monitor.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img style="height:250px" src="Photos/monitor.jpg"></div>
<h2>That is all I have, thank you for reading this. :D</h2>
