                <p style="text-align:center;color:white;font-family:Oswald">Here, any Turtle, or person can look at what html is, whats inside an old Dell Vostro 1015, and even learn a bit about me. You, as the visitor, are free to see whatever you would like. Feel free to explore!</p>
                <h3 style="color:white;text-align:center;">Why did you do this site?</h3>
                <p style="color:white">My name is Erick, and I did this site for my Coding class. I wanted to go to a coding class, because i've been interested in computers, ever since i was little (around 7). </p>
                <h3>What is my class all about?</h3>
                <p>My class, as described above, is a coding class for any student who attends high school at Summit (at least that's what I know). Our teacher is Mr. Hesby, who is chill and respects us all. Our class is roughly 20 student, and all of us work at our own pace on (what is current) working on our websites(which is clearly signified here).</p>
                <h3>Is there anything else I do in this class?</h3>
                <p>Of course! We usually take small breaks, and when we're not doing that, we usually play class activities.</p>
                <h3>Is this class only going to do webpages, or something else?</h3>
                <p>When we go to our second expedition, we will stay in his class to learn even more code, such as Java script.</p>
