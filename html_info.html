        <h1 style="background-color:white">Hello fellow HTML5 fans, welcome!<!--span--></h1>
        <h2 style="font-family:arial;text-align:center;">Here, we will be talking about what HTML5 is, and where/why we use it.</h2>
        <h2> What is HTML and why is it important?</h2>
        <p>Html is hyper text markup language, or, what you normally would see in a webpage in 1997.</p>
        <h2>The reason we use it, is for multiple reasons:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Used as a foundation for a webpage</li>
            <li>Makes for a great beginner language</li>
            <li>Can be used to create your own webpage(such as here)
                <li>More simpler to use than other languages that are the same</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Where did it come from?</h2>
        <p>It came from Berners-Lee, at CERN using SGML, an earlier form of language, similar to HTML. It was formally defined as that by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) within the middle of 1993.</p>
        <h2>How is HTML written?</h2>
        <p>Here is an example of code, that is written with HTML5:</p>
        <div style="text-align:center">
            <img src="http://www.scriptingmaster.com/images/html/readable-HTML-code.jpg">
        </div>
        <h2>What is CSS then?</h2>
        <p>CSS is an extention to HTML: it is responsible for all the visual elements that the HTML page produces.</p>
        <h2>Why is it so important?</h2>
        <p>Nowadays, everyone want there website to look modern, and clean. So, in order to do that without HTML code changing drasticaly, they instead, made CSS, so that HTML would not be too crowded.</p>
        <h2>What does it stand for?</h2>
        <p>I stands for Cascading Style Sheets, or in simpler terms, an element used to make things look better.</p>
        <h2>How is it used, write CSS?</h2>
        <p>Of course not! You write css similar to how you write HTML</p>
        <h2>Where did it come from?</h2>
        <p>When the international organization that owned HTML, thought that the page looked too dull, they tought of a briliant plan to develop a sub-language, thats only purpose was to make pages look better.</p>
        <h2>How is it written?</h2>
        <p>The following is an example of CSS, canging all page backgrounds to a picture.</p>
        <p>
            body{ background-image: url("Photos/About_background.jpg")</p>
        <h1>How do those body tags work?</h1>
        <p>When you write a body tag, you tell the comuter to create, or in this case, write the tag in a CSS file. For example, if you want to change the color of all the paragraphs, you write the tag "p", and then write style="color:(color goes here)"</p>
        <h1>How do you write a tag?</h1>
        <p>Simple. In HTML, you would writen is as the folowing: WARNING: the folowing is copyrighted. Don't get any ideas ;)
        </p>
        <div style="text-align:center">
            <img src="Old_Projects/Images/html_m8.png">
        </div>
        <p>Notice how the bottom has the same names (the letters in black), as the navigation bar. That is because, it is part of the navigational bar! That is not copyrighted, instead anyone can use it!</p>
        <p>(As long as you can code HTML and CSS...)</p>
        <h2>What are attributes?</h2>
        <p>Attributes are the things that determine how and object, paragraph, even letters will show up like. Atrributes can be changed, via HTML, or for more bigger changes, CSS. Some examples of atrributes are shown below (for CSS).</p>
        <div style="text-align:center">
