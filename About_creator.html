    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Hello people who are interested in me, welcome!</h1>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">I won't go talking about too much of me, so here I go.</h2>
    <h1 style="text-align:center;"> My name is Erick Espinoza (if you read the bottom of every page, you would know). And, the reson I am doing this is because I
  wanted people to know more about me (I am the creator after all :D). So, lets get started!
</h1>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">What do you like to do in your spare time?</h2>
    <p style="text-align:center;">I usually like to play around with computers, watch youtube videos, and run virtual machines :)</p>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">What is your favorite subject?</h2>
    <p style="text-align:center;">My favorite subject is science, yet my easiest subject is english</p>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">How was middle school, the place you graduated from?</h2>
    <p style="text-align:center;">Middle school was great, I had a lot of fun doing things I didn't know I could do.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align:center;">What got you into computers?</h2>
    <p style="text-align:center;">The fact that a computer was, as I understood at the time, alive. It was amazing to see something besides life, working in some tiny little box.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">What's a virtual machine?</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">A virtual machine, is part of a program that is capable of running an operating system, as a program. For example: you turn on your mac or pc(no chromebooks :( and run a special program that has the potential to run diffrent operating systems, all while on your computer.</p>
